        Overview of PAPRIKA. We design a diverse set of tasks where an LLM agent needs strategic information gathering to succeed, 
        then train an LLM on self-generated data to prefer higher performing trajectories. The resulting behavior learned by PAPRIKA 
        can transfer zero-shot to unseen tasks, showcasing its potential to build general decision making agents.

            Efficient exploration is essential for intelligent systems interacting with their environment, but 
            existing language models often fall short in scenarios that require strategic information gathering. 
            In this paper, we present PAPRIKA, a fine-tuning approach that enables language models to develop general 
            decision-making capabilities that are not confined to particular environments. By training on synthetic 
            interaction data from different tasks that require diverse strategies, PAPRIKA teaches models to explore and 
            adapt their behavior on a new task based on environment feedback in-context without more gradient updates. 
            Experimental results show that models fine-tuned with PAPRIKA can effectively transfer their learned 
            decision-making capabilities to entirely unseen tasks without additional training. Unlike traditional training, 
            our approach's primary bottleneck lies in sampling useful interaction data instead of model updates. 
            To improve sample efficiency, we propose a curriculum learning strategy that prioritizes sampling trajectories 
            from tasks with high learning potential. These results suggest a promising path towards AI systems that can 
            autonomously solve novel sequential decision-making problems that require interactions with the external world.

            We considered three problems for our experiments: (1) a didactic bandit problems that are easy to simulate, (2) Synthetic LLM 
            fine-tuning problems, where ground-truth reward functions exist and are easy to track (though we still train the policy against a proxy reward model), 
            and (3) Full-scale LLM fine-tuning on AlpacaFarm and UltraFeedback. We use these problems to study the impact of on-policy sampling
            and negative gradients on performance and behavior of algorithms.

          <p>
            The performance of preference-finetuning algorithms can be affected by several factors: (1) the coverage of the preference dataset, 
            (2) the reference policy initialization, and (3) the underlying ground truth reward distribution. To study this impact, we consider two
            orthogonal axes: [C1] the geometric alignment between the ground-truth reward function and the reference policy initialization and [C2] the 
            coverage of the preference data used to train the surrogate reward model relative to the reference policy. Condition [C1] is reminiscent of 
            concentrability coefficient in RL and condition [C2] fundamentally imposes a condition on statistical errors in the reward model on different responses.

            Understanding the behavior of various approaches as a function of these factors will allow us to better understand the performance of 
            various approaches on downstream fine-tuning in terms of problem geometry [C1] and statistical learning considerations [C2]. More concretely, in the synthetic LLM setting we consider the following cases

        <h3 class="title is-4">Characterizing Fine-Tuning Methods</h3>
        In this work, we study the role of on-policy sampling and negative gradients in existing preference fine-tuning algorithms. 
        We characterize fine-tuning methods based on three key properties:
        <div class="content has-text-justified">
          <ol>
            <li><b>on-policy sampling:</b> explicit sampling of new responses from the policy or purely learning from offline data</li>
            <li><b>on-policy sample reuse:</b> for only those approaches that perform on-policy sampling, whether the approach makes more 
              than one gradient update on a given prompt-response (𝑥, 𝑦) pair</li>
            <li><b>negative gradient:</b> whether the approach explicitly minimizes a loss that attempts to “push-down” likelihood on 
              certain responses by multiplying the gradient of their likelihood with a negative coefficient </li>

            To study the impact of on-policy sampling, we vary the extent to which updates are made on data from the current policy. 
            Below, we introduce Algorithm 1, which is a encapsulates how fine-tuning algorithms updates on preference data.

            One way in which we can control the amount of on-policy sampling in Algorithm 1 is by by varying the total number of samples |𝒟| = 𝐵/𝐶 × 𝐶 = 𝐵 
            used for a given training iteration but keeping minibatch size 𝑀 used for the gradient update fixed, assuming the algorithm performs exactly one pass over all this sampled data. One result from the paper is shown below:

            <b>Performance on AlpacaFarm with varying batch sizes.</b> We see that decreasing the batch size improves performance,

            of this sampling when the reference policy is far from the optimal policy.

              <b>Takeaway: </b>On-policy sampling generally improves performance and efficiency, especially in cases when the 
              peak of reward appears farther from the reference policy, even when the reward model is learned from the same 
              preference dataset that methods use without on-policy learning also use. In some cases, sample reuse can reduce 
              the dependency on on-policy sampling of data, but it presents a tradeoff by reducing exploration of the response space.

        <div class="content has-text-justified">
          <p>
          To understand the role of negative gradient, we will compare contrastive algorithms (e.g., DPO or IPO) with maximum likelihood supervised methods (e.g., Best-of-N) in a fully offline setting, 
          where no new on-policy samples are collected. In the paper, we compare various algorithms and also explore mechanisms behind the behaviors of methods. 

          Our main finding is that negative gradients often speed up convergence of algorithms, often allowing them to reach a better solution. For example, 
          in one of the settings, we compare supervised Best-of-N to supervised Best-of-N with a negative gradient explicitly added and observe that the latter
          is able to quickly learn to find a better solution. Likewise we also find DPO attains better results.

              If not, the margin between log likelihoods of preferred and dispreferred will still be larger when a negative gradient is used, 
              but the recovered probability mass will go into increasing likelihoods of other responses, not the preferred response necessarily.

          <p>
            On-policy sampling and offline negative gradients present complementary benefits, in that
            the best offline loss function with negative gradients can be used to train on on-policy data,
            improving over on-policy RL or supervised learning. Conceptually, while sampling responses
            on-policy provides coverage of the response space, an effective negative gradient loss provides
            a stronger learning signal given a set of samples. It can also result in computational benefits.

            (min length and skew length), and all algorithms perform similarly when these two policies are close (mode length).

              <b>Takeaway: </b>We observe that the best offline loss function with negative gradients can be used to train on on-policy data, improving over on-policy RL or supervised learning. 
              In our experiments, we find this loss function to be a contrastive loss akin to DPO or IPO. Running these contrastive methods on on-policy data helps improve performance. 
              This can also result in computational benefits, improving over wall-clock time.

            With empirical results showing the benefits of on-policy sampling and negative gradient for preference fine-tuning of LLMs, 
            we tie these two approaches together under the notion of mode-seeking objectives in contrast to mode-covering objectives 
            such as (weighted / filtered) maximum likelihood.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the paper, we argue (in Lemmas 6.1 and 6.2) that (1) on-policy algorithms are mode-seeking as they optimize the regularized
            reverse-KL objective and (2) if the negative responses are chosen appropriately, then the contrastive update accelerates the 
            rate of increase of probability mass on the preferred responses and exhibits mode-seeking behavior. For more details, 
            formal definitions, and the proof of these theoretical results, please refer to the paper.

            We then also analyze the benefits of mode-seeking behavior formally via a case study on reverse (mode-seeking) and forward KL (mode-covering) divergences. 
            Prior work typically shows that the benefits of mode-seeking behavior 
            of this sort are more apparent when the model 𝑝(𝑥) is unable to realize 
            the target distribution 𝑞(𝑥), such that minimizing either KL would give rise to 
            difference solutions. Unlike this prior argument, our theoretical argument in Theorem 6.5
            shows that even when the 𝑝(𝑥) can fully represent the target distribution 𝑞(𝑥), 
            when training with gradient descent, reverse KL is able to quickly
            re-distribute probability mass to only a subset of the required categories likely in 
            target distribution within a few gradient update steps. 
            This is especially important when early stopping is used and the loss cannot be minimized to exactly 0 
            on the training data -- in such cases, we would expect the reverse KL divergence to quickly redistribute probability mass in a way that is more effective.
            We illustrate a toy version of this idea using a numerical toy experiment as seen below.

          <b>Takeaway: </b>We conceptually unify on-policy sampling and negative gradients under the notion of mode-seeking objectives, 
          extended to categorical distributions. An analysis of the behavior of some representative mode-seeking and mode-covering objectives
          corroborates our empirical observations in this paper.
